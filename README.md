# Club-Penguin-Dungeon-Crawl
I created a Club Penguin themed, old school style, dungeon crawl game. You get to explore the map, passing through familiar locations, while picking up items along the way. You must pick up all of the items in order to defeat Herbert P. Bear, the main antagonist. When you enter a new room, you'll see all the possible doors you can enter, but beware, one of them might lead directly to Herbert! I have provided a map in case you'd like to know exactly where to go. 

I created the base of this project by using Dante Lee's tutorial on YouTube, but I made many changes along the way to make it more my own and follow the story I wanted to tell. I'll link his video below.
